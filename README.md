# ROS 2 Driver for EY09A Laser Rangefinder

This package provides a ROS 2 driver for the EY09A Micro Laser Rangefinder, enabling communication via USB/UART to publish range data.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

  * **ROS 2 (Humble or equivalent):** Installed and sourced on your system.
  * **Python 3.8+:** ROS 2 typically comes with a compatible Python version.
  * **`pyserial`:** This Python library is essential for serial communication. It will be installed in a later step.
  * **Serial Port Access:** Your user needs permissions to access serial ports (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`). To grant this, run:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
    ```
    **You must log out and log back in (or reboot) for this change to take effect.**

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up and run the ROS 2 driver:

1.  **Navigate to your home directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ~
    ```

2.  **Create a ROS 2 workspace:**

    ```bash
    mkdir -p lidar_ws/src
    ```

3.  **Change into the source directory of your new workspace:**

    ```bash
    cd lidar_ws/src
    ```

4.  **Clone the `rangefinder` ROS 2 package:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/a11m234/rangefinder.git
    ```

5.  **Change into the cloned package directory:**

    ```bash
    cd rangefinder
    ```

6.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    This step ensures that `pyserial` and any other required Python libraries are installed within your system's Python environment (or the one your `pip3` points to).

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

      * **Note:** If you encounter permission errors, you might need to use `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. However, it's generally recommended to avoid `sudo pip3` if possible by ensuring your user has appropriate permissions or by using Python virtual environments.

7.  **Navigate back to the root of your ROS 2 workspace:**

    ```bash
    cd ~/lidar_ws/
    ```

8.  **Build the ROS 2 package:**

    ```bash
    colcon build
    ```

    This command compiles your package and its dependencies. If there are no errors, the build will complete successfully.

9.  **Source the ROS 2 workspace:**
    To make your newly built package discoverable by ROS 2, you need to source the workspace setup file.

      * **For the current terminal session:**

        ```bash
        source install/setup.bash
        ```

      * **For permanent setup (recommended):** Add the sourcing command to your `~/.bashrc` file. This will automatically source the workspace every time you open a new terminal.

        ```bash
        echo "source ~/lidar_ws/install/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
        source ~/.bashrc # Apply changes to the current terminal
        ```

## Running the Driver

After completing the installation and sourcing your workspace, you can launch the lidar driver:

1.  **Launch the ROS 2 node:**

    ```bash
    ros2 launch rangefinder rangefinder_launch.py
    ```

      * **Specify Serial Port (if different from default `/dev/ttyUSB0`):**
        ```bash
        ros2 launch rangefinder rangefinder_launch.py serial_port:=/dev/ttyACM0
        ```
        Replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with the actual serial port your EY09A rangefinder is connected to.
        These could be `/dev/ttyS0` or `/dev/ttyAMA0` ( for UART ) you can check for this  by using
        ```bash
        ls /dev/tty*
        ```
        if this cmd show the avaiable uart and usb based device with it port name 
2.  **Verify Data (in a new terminal):**
    Open a **new terminal** and ensure your ROS 2 workspace is sourced (as per step 9). Then, you can view the published range data:

    ```bash
    ros2 topic echo /rangefinder/range
    ```

You should now see `sensor_msgs/msg/Range` messages being continuously published, indicating that the driver is successfully communicating with your EY09A rangefinder.
